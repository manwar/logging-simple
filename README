NAME

    Log::Simple - A simple but featureful logging mechanism.

SYNOPSIS

        use Log::Simple;
    
        my $log = Log::Simple->new(name => 'whatever'); # name is optional
    
        $log->warning("default level (4)");
    
        $log->_4("all levels can be called by number. This is warning()");
    
        $log->_7("this is debug(). Default level is 4, so this won't print");
    
        $log->level(7);
        $log->debug("same as _7(). It'll print now");
    
        $log->file('file.log');
        $log->info("this will go to file");
        $log->file(0); # back to STDOUT
    
        $log->_6("info facility, example output");
        #[2016-03-17 16:49:32.491][info][whatever] info facility, example output
    
        $log->display(0);
        $log->info("display(0) disables all output but this msg");
        $log->info("see display() method for disabling, enabling individual tags");
    
        $log->display(1);
        $log->info("all tags enabled");
        #[2016-03-17 16:52:06.356][info][whatever][5689][t/syn.pl|29] all tags enabled
    
        $log->print(0);
        my $log_entry = $log->info("print(0) disables printing and returns the entry");

DESCRIPTION

    Lightweight (core-only) and very simple yet powerful debug tool for
    printing or writing to file log type entries based on a configurable
    level (0-7).

    It provides the ability to programmatically change which output tags to
    display, provides numbered methods so you don't have to remember the
    name to number level translation, provides the ability to create
    descendent children, easily enable/disable file output, levels, display
    etc.

 Log entry format

    By default, log entries appear as such, with a timestamp, the name of
    the facility, the name (if specified in the constructor) and finally
    the actual log entry message.

        [2016-03-17 17:01:21.959][info][whatever] info facility, example output

    All of the above tags can be enabled/disabled programatically at any
    time, and there are others that are not enabled by default. See display
    method for details.

 Levels

    Verbosity and associated levels are:

    - level 0, 'emergency|emerg' =item - level 1, `alert` =item - level 2,
    `critical|crit` =item - level 3, `error|err` =item - level 4,
    `warning|warn` =item - level 5, `notice` =item - level 6, `info` =item
    - level 7, `debug`

    Note that all named level methods have an associated _N method, so you
    don't have to remember the names at all.

    Setting the level will display all messages related to that level and
    below.
