NAME

    Log::Simple - Perl extension for simple logging.

SYNOPSIS

      perl -MLog::Simple -e 'info "hey"'
      
      use Log::Simple;
      $Log::Simple::VERBOSITY=3;
      debug "stuff"; # won't be printed
      info "here is the info message"; # won't be printed
      warning "wow! beware!";
      error "something terrible happend !";
      msg "this message will be displayed whatever the verbosity level";
      sep "a separator";
      fatal "fatal error: $!";

DESCRIPTION

    Log::Simple displays formatted messages according to the defined
    verbosity level (default:4).

 Format

    Log messages are formatted as: `[<level>] <date> - <message>`. Dates
    are formatted as: `YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss`. Your message could be whatever
    you what.

 Levels

    Verbosity and associated levels are:

    - level 1, `msg`

    - level 2, `error`

    - level 3, `warn`

    - level 4, `info`

    - level 5, `debug`

    - no level, `fatal`

    Setting verbosity to 3 will print `warn`, `info`, and `msg` only.

 Special cases

    `fatal` is a special level, corresponding to perl's `die()`.

    Separator is a special functions which display a line of 80 dashes,
    with your message eventually.

 Saving to file

    All messages will also be appended to a file. If a `./log/` folder
    exists, a `$$.$0.log` file is created within this folder, otherwise the
    `$$.$0.log` file is created in the current directory.

EXPORT

    debug info warning error msg sep fatal
